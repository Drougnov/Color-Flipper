## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Thanks for cheking out this repository.

## What is it about

It's a random color generator made with vanilla JS. I've been learning basic javascript project form [jhon smilga's youtube course](https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4). I learned the simple and hex one from his tutorial. I did the rest on my own. I didn't focus on the ui much. The simple color array was copied form [here](https://gist.github.com/bobspace/2712980).
